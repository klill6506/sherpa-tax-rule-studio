## 2026-06-10 PM #5 — 1040 SPINE spec authored (Sprint Topic 1), READY_TO_SEED=False
- `specs/management/commands/load_1040_spine.py` authored: updates the Session-14
  "1040" stub TaxForm in place into the full spine spec. **45 rules (100% cited,
  72 authority links), 91 facts, 72 lines, 16 diagnostics, 33 scenarios, 16 flow
  assertions (FA-1040-SPINE-01..16), 11 new authority sources.**
- Stub retirement: the loader deletes R001/R002 (re-specified as R-CR-03/R-PAY-06),
  fact `line_11_agi` (→ `agi`), and line "11" (→ 11a/11b) with stdout notes.
- All constants transcribed from primary sources fetched + layout-extracted the
  same day: 2025 f1040.pdf (both pages, line by line); Pub 1040-TT (2025) Tax
  Table + Tax Computation Worksheet; i1040gi (2025) Line 16 routing / std-ded
  exceptions / L37-38 rules; Pub 501 (2025) Tables 6/7/8; RP 2024-40 §2.01;
  RP 2025-32 §4.01/§4.14; OBBBA §70102.
- **Tax Table convention verified, not assumed:** rows are $10/$25/$50 bands
  (0-5→$0; 5-25 by $10; 25-3,000 by $25; 3,000-100,000 by $50); row tax = rate
  schedule at the band MIDPOINT rounded HALF-UP (pinned by published rows
  302.50→303, 357.50→358, and the 99,950-100,000 row across all four columns).
  QSS uses the MFJ column (footnote). ≥$100,000 → TCW ≡ cumulative brackets
  (verified equal at $100,000). The midpoint inference is flagged for Ken's
  explicit blessing in the review packet.
- `check_spine_integrity.py` (repo root): pre-seed content-list checker —
  uncited rules / dangling links / duplicate ids / excerpt+choice field
  validation. Run via `Get-Content check_spine_integrity.py -Raw | poetry run
  python manage.py shell` (or exec in a shell). All checks pass.
- Guard verified: `manage.py load_1040_spine` refuses with CommandError while
  `READY_TO_SEED = False`. No DB writes this session.
- Next: Ken's review walk (packet prepared in tts-tax-app session) → flip →
  seed → export → wire into tts-tax-app compute.

## 2026-06-10 PM — SCH_1A seeded on Ken's approval
- Review packet walked with Ken in-session (constants, rounding directions,
  17 requires_human_review excerpts, diagnostics severities, 5 documented
  v1 deviations in tts-tax-app). **Approved.**
- `READY_TO_SEED` flipped → `load_sch_1a` run: 38 rules, 47 lines, 31 facts,
  6 diagnostics, 21 scenarios, 7 flow assertions, 66 authority links (all
  rules cited). RS DB now 30 forms.
- Export verified via `lookup/SCH_1A/export/`; committed to tts-tax-app as
  the canonical `server/specs/sch_1a_spec.json`. tts-tax-app implemented
  Part IV (car loan) from it the same day — all 21 scenarios green.
- Flow-assertion export note: `/api/flow-assertions/export/?entity_type=1040`
  returns 20 (13 CTC + 7 SCH1A). RS SCH1A-01..04 duplicate locally-wired
  assertions in tts-tax-app; -05/-06/-07 were newly wired there.

## 2026-06-10 — 1040 campaign Phase 0 state audit (read-only)
- No RS code or data changes. Inventoried authored specs vs. the deployed DB.
- Deployed RS DB holds 29 seeded forms (all status=draft). 1040-relevant: SCH_8812
  (1,140 facts/rules — exported + implemented in tts-tax-app), 1040 stub (2 rules:
  L11/19/28), plus business forms reusable at the 1040 level.
- **SCH_1A status confirmed: authored, NOT seeded.** All six parts + 21 test
  scenarios + 7 diagnostics + 8 flow assertions live in
  `specs/management/commands/load_sch_1a.py` with `READY_TO_SEED = False` (line 77).
  Awaiting Ken's review → flip → seed → export → verify (tts-tax-app already
  implements Parts I/II/III/V/VI from Ken's scope docs; Part IV is spec-ahead-of-compute).
- Noted: RS has no per-form `ready_to_seed` DB field — the sentinel is per-loader-command.
- RS root STATUS.md / MEMORY.md / DECISIONS.md are stale (last touched 2026-04-27,
  pre-dating Sessions 14-17). Update them next time RS work happens.

## Backfill — sessions before this log existed (from git history)

  21 scenarios (`4273295`, `0d49a44`, `ab45137`). NOT seeded.
- **2026-05-26 (Session 14):** SCH_8812 (CTC/ACTC) spec authored + seeded + exported
