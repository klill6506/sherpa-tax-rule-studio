## 2026-06-10 — 1040 campaign Phase 0 state audit (read-only)
- No RS code or data changes. Inventoried authored specs vs. the deployed DB.
- Deployed RS DB holds 29 seeded forms (all status=draft). 1040-relevant: SCH_8812
  (1,140 facts/rules — exported + implemented in tts-tax-app), 1040 stub (2 rules:
  L11/19/28), plus business forms reusable at the 1040 level.
- **SCH_1A status confirmed: authored, NOT seeded.** All six parts + 21 test
  scenarios + 7 diagnostics + 8 flow assertions live in
  `specs/management/commands/load_sch_1a.py` with `READY_TO_SEED = False` (line 77).
  Awaiting Ken's review → flip → seed → export → verify (tts-tax-app already
  implements Parts I/II/III/V/VI from Ken's scope docs; Part IV is spec-ahead-of-compute).
- Noted: RS has no per-form `ready_to_seed` DB field — the sentinel is per-loader-command.
- RS root STATUS.md / MEMORY.md / DECISIONS.md are stale (last touched 2026-04-27,
  pre-dating Sessions 14-17). Update them next time RS work happens.
